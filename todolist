figure out iframe dynamic sizing thing, why is javascript not working??

really, maybe iframe not the way to go, what about using the templating system like flask uses? - not worth it either, that's more useful for dynamic rendering i think... although maybe worth it for DRY principle, so if i make changes later??


OK SO now, the templating is working. see the buildpages.py file for commments on what's next
